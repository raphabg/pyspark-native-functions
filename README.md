# pyspark-native-functions

Just a proof of concept of the usage of native apache spark custom functions with the pyspark interface. This approach allows native spark UDFs to benefit from spark catalyst optimization.

Please check the notebooks to undestand better, actually it's a pretty minimal POC and some ml experiments which I still have to revisit...
